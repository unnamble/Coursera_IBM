    "Like many other capitals around the world, Copenhagen are home to a lot of small business owners consisting of many different kinds business types. If one were to open  let’s say a new burger joint in a specific borough, it would be nice to know how many burger joints which are present in that borough, before you choose a location. Likewise, it would be nice to know how many people resides in the area of question. My final project will answer these  two questions."

    "For the geolocations of the boroughs I used google maps and took the coordinates in the center of the boroughs, thereafter I plotted it manually in the script.\n",
    "3. Data for Copenhagen concerning number of residents in a specific area and borough limits and administrative units.\n",
    "For the specific data concerning Copenhagen, I make use the municipality open data portal https://data.kk.dk/dataset, which has a lot of information concerning Copenhagen. I will use a geojson with borough limits to show were the clusters are positioned within a specific borough.\n",
    "A second part of the script will show the results on a choropleth map with population in specific areas. For that I will use a csv. file with administrative zones** + number of occupants in those zones and put that together with a geojson map  that also have the administrative zones.\n",

    "** The statistics for population stats are linked to an old administrative unit called “roder”, it’s neither a neighborhood nor a borough, but the smallest administrative unit used for different statistics. \n"
